# How does NextJS Works
Using Next.js, you can create robust react based application quite easily and test them. Following are the key features of Next.js.

- **Hot Code Reload** − Next.js server detects modified files and reloads them automatically.

- **Automatic Routing** − No need to configure any url for routing. files are to be placed in pages folder. All urls will be mapped to file system. Customization can be done.

- **Component specific styles** − styled-jsx provides support for global as well as component specific styles.

- **Server side rendering** − react components are prerendered on server hence loads faster on client.

- **Node Ecosystem** − Next.js being react based gels well with Node ecosystem.

- **Automatic code split** − Next.js renders pages with libraries they need. Next.js instead of creating a single large javascript file, creates multiples resources. When a page is loaded, only required javascript page is loaded with it.

- **Prefetch** − Next.js provides Link component which is used to link multiple components supports a prefetch property to prefetch page resources in background.

- **Dynamic Components** − Next.js allows to import JavaScript modules and React Components dynamically.

- **Export Static Site** − Next.js allows to export full static site from your web application.

- **Built-in Typescript Support** − Next.js is written in Typescripts and provides excellent Typescript support.
